# Summary notes

State options using processes
___

- Agent - Simple wrappers around state.
- GenServer - “Generic servers” (processes) that encapsulate state, provide sync and async calls, support code reloading, and more.
- Task - Asynchronous units of computation that allow spawning a process and potentially retrieving its result at a later time.
